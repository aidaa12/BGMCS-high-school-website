        <p class="abpar1">Ten years ago, the Regional State Bureau of Education and an overwhelming number of Bahir Dar city residents
            appealed to the Bahir Dar Catholic Development Coordination Office to open a high school in the area, so that
             disadvantages children from the area could receive an education, in order to avoid a life of living on the street.
             The High School relies on the generosity of donors to pay the teacher’s salaries and school fees for most of
            the children. Some families are a position to pay a proportion of the school fees and this goes directly to
            the running costs of the school.</p>
            <p class="abpar1">BGMCS High School offers extensive academic and extracurricular
                experiences to ensure high levels of learning for all students.
                BGMCS’ ability to offer such opportunities is supported in large part
                by the BGMCS staff and community. Located in the
                heart of BahirDar city, Ethiopia</p>
            <p class="abpar1">The community’s diversity is reflected by BGMCS High School’s student
                population through a blend of ethnicities,
                cultures, socioeconomic and academic backgrounds.
                What is particularly impressive is the sense of community
                one feels when stepping onto the BGMCS campus.
                Providing college preparatory education for all students provides
                staff the welcome challenge of meeting these diverse needs.</p>
                <p class="abpar1">At BGMCS More college preparatory boarding school,
                we strive to embody a full and diverse experience in order
                 to best prepare our students for the things that matter.
                 Diversity is promoted and celebrated as a core value that
                 greatly enriches one's academic pursuits. We proudly welcome
                  students committed to reaching their highest potential from all
                   corners of the globe and walks of life. We also believe that all
                    students should be empowered to reach their highest potential,
                    despite any past hardships. Here, our students will learn an
                    essential truth: the more you apply yourself, the more you can achieve.</p>
